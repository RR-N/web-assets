One time when I was a kid, we visited friends that lived by the Rhine. At one point we went to this little deck by its bank when out of nowhere the river rises and we get caught in it. My mom, my brother, and I managed to climb up the stairs (and cry), but my dad dove straight in after my mom's purse which had been caught by the water.We had a tiny poodle at the time that was famously wimpy (her name was Millie and she would pee herself whenever she got too excited or scared -- even yelling at her would do the job), but she was also extremely attached to specifically my dad. When he dove after the purse, she dove after him and tried to pull this large 250 lbs German man towards the land by his wrist. She almost drowned in the process.

When we moved to the states we were worried that the Florida climate would be too much for her as she was really fluffy and weak of constitution, so we rehomed her with close family friends that spoiled her rotten and kept us updated on how she was doing. She passed away last year, but every time my dad visited Germany, he'd go and see her.
