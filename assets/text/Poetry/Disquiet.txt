What's so punk about the whore of Babylon?

What isn't punk about the bloodguilt of the whore of Babylon?

What's so punk about bloodguilt?

What's not punk about this particular bloodguilt?

Jesus didn't like it.

Jesus was a terrorist.

Your terrorist is my messiah.

There are no messiahs.

Edgy.

True.

So god ate his foot?

He was very embarrassed apparently.

About what?

She tricked him too.

Babylon?

Yes.

Well, her kind snuck up on him I guess.

Our kind.

I've never built a thing.

You're part of it.

I'm clean.

You're immersed.

I'm pious.

How?

I do rituals and I go to church, and I live a Christian life.

U, that isn’t piety.

What is piety?

Piety is devotion.

I’m devoted.

No. You follow instructions. You don’t study or embody.

Church is study. Through christian life, morality, I embody Christ’s teachings.

That’s not embodiment. That’s following instructions.

You’re ridiculous. What counts as embodiment in your mind?

I don’t know. But it’s not you.

How do you know that if you can’t even define it?

Embodiment would be divine. You’re not divine.

How do you know?

I would know.

Have you known anything divine?

No.

So then how do you know divine from not-divine?

Divinity transcends. It’s innately different from not-divine, in a way I would innately know.

How do you know that? What makes you think divinity-telling doesn’t require training?

By definition, it can’t.

What does that even mean?

If you were divine, you’d know.

I’m not divine, I embody divine ideals. Or try to.

If you embodied divine ideals, you’d know.

That’s ridiculous.

You believe in divinity!

Read your Polkinghorne!

SCENE!

What do you think?

I honestly have no commentary to offer what-so-ever. That was so weird and not entertaining.

You didn’t think it was funny?

What was supposed to be funny about that?!

SCENE! What do you think?

It feels kind of vapid.

Vapid?

You namedrop biblical figures but never relate them to anything concrete.

What figures?

The whore of Babylon. Jesus. You even mention Polkinghorne at the end but then end the scene before you ever have to elaborate.

Polkinghorne isn’t a biblical figure.

I know. But have you ever even read Polkinghorne?

Of course.

Have you really?

I have really.

Prove it.

This isn’t a rigorous discussion.

What?

This isn’t a rigorous discussion. This isn’t the kind of conversation in which we arrive at genuine truth.

What do you mean?

It’s so wishy-washy. So nebulous. So vague and dynamic. It’s not rigorous. There’s no accountability.

“Wishy-washy” definitely isn’t rigorous.

My point exactly!

But we could make this a rigorous discussion?

How?

Have you read any Poincare?

SCENE!


What?

SCENE!

You can’t just yell “scene” like that ends the discussion.

SCENE!!!

Come on. So you haven’t read Poincare.

I have read Poincare!

It’s okay to not have read everything.

I have read everything.

No one expects you to know everything.

But I am studious and know many things.

This is stupid. Stop pretending. Be real.

SCENE!

SCENE!

What?!

SCENE!

Stop!!

Doesn’t feel great, does it?

It doesn’t.

Okay. So let’s not do that anymore.

Ok.

Thank you.

I have grown as a person and I’m more grounded now.

Well that’s good.

Yes it is.

So going back to what we were talking about: have you read Poincare?

SCENE!
