Do you know what it meant to me for you to read my story?
Did it resonate with you? Did you feel what I felt writing and rewriting, and rewriting it again?

It is all that I could ever want, for my words to reach you. I want to cultivate a linkage, a bridge between your heart and mine. I want to be your friend without ever having known you, and I want us both to feel a little less alone with every word we share.

I want you to whisper every sentence, the shushes sharpening the fricatives snuck slyly from your tongue. I want you to place your pregnant pauses, and play happily with all my words, to twist them with inflections and injections, and I pray you find your joy in them.

I hope you smile when the prose meets you well, 
that you frown when my texts betray your heart, 
and what I crave more than anything 
is that youâ€™ll trust me in my craft,
and know it will not have been for nothing.

Even if it rings hollow;
I love you for reading this.
