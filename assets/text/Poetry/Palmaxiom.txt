It is
disrupted by the shimmer of the sunlight in the pool
and the tiger stripes of shade
drawn on skin by the palms above. 
\n
The wind carries a loving warmth
and with it, the stowaway tones
of jazz and rhythm and blues. 
\n
The breath falls easy as the currents move hair, 
and motions beget sensations which give birth,
and space to be aware. 
\n
Muscles twitch and sinews stretch;
membranes brace under shifting pressures,
mechanical energy is exerted and turns to heat
as a body learns of its physique.
\n
Limbs disperse
their weights afloat the water, 
and ease the pivots of joints
which seek the comfort of angles and ranges. 
\n
With synchronous blinks
the eyes find their mate,
and practiced lenses refract light
into the verdant ridges and ripples
of shrinking irises. 
\n
One blink, two blinks, three blinks, four –
an urgent *you* springs alive,
and notes the sudden sharpness of wavelets
clashing and splashing atǒur.
