It's standard practice among direct action groups to designate a point person for all law enforcement exchanges if you're expecting arrests. This is usually someone who has been trained on how to handle these interactions and who is not themselves risking arrest. Everyone else is generally instructed to tell inquiring law enforcement that they should speak to this liaison but not acknowledge them as any sort of leader/authority. You're not supposed to say anything beyond that unless absolutely necessary.

Between the backpack and the calm demeanor, I'd bet money that that is exactly what you're seeing play out here. If so, the two men in the clip played their roles perfectly -- the protester primarily addressed the crowd and only spoke to law enforcement to the extent required to comply with their requests, while the mediator was indistinguishable from bystanders until the moment he was needed.
