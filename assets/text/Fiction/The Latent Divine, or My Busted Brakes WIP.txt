## Chapter I: GMV

It began with a rapture darkness that covered the world. There were no verbs, nor subjects to seize them; there was no tightness, nor egress to relieve it. An absence of all percepts, and all which would perceive, no sense nor space to anchor relativity. A nothing so nothing, it defied causality, left null and never all of time and temporality. It was symphonic and cacophony, it was mundane and special all the same, it was all that ever was and ever would be, it was the start, the end, and the in-between. Until it popped, or faded, all at once, or very slowly, unseen by anyone, but known to everyone in hindsight.

However it happened, what was before gave way to a soreness, something like a raw wound, like a gash after birth, or like an infant blinded by the first sight of the sun. It was all so much, so overwhelming – it might have burned out what eyes I still had, made me bleed out my ears if I could only have remembered the blood in my veins, or a heart to pump it. That was my first missed sign of the incorporeal, ironically: All the things-that-were-too-much overwhelmed my senses, but never hurt what would once have been my body. If only I’d realized that there was still a me worth sparing a thought.

I was there, like that, not standing or sitting, not lying or floating, but just being, for a stretch that drew out so long that it seemed to defy description by units of time. Whatever I was, or whatever I’d come to be, it took a lot of that, it cost me much of that, to adjust to it, to compress the buzz and the noise and the all-too-much of it all, until slowly, it began to take shape. It seemed at first like the afterimage of a light you’d looked at for far too long, or the forms and not-quite-forms that you see when you close your eyes. It was vague and abstract, and it would never take hold, and for the longest time, a portion of my mind would always be occupied attempting to interpret the sheer signal of it all… Still, the moment came when, at last,  I could interpret some semblance of what I reckon to be a place.

I call it a place because all other terms (like world, or space, or environment) ascribe it too many qualities that I could not yet positively identify. It wasn’t entirely clear to me whether the place had an end, or boundaries, or dimensions of any kind. What features it most definitely had were scarce: it exists, and I exist in some location within it. It was a strange, intellectual thing, and something entirely foreign to what I’d come to know as corporeal space.

On finding the place, I’d initially been far too confused and out of my element to feel much of anything, but in time I remembered that there was such a thing that it was like to be, that is, that my experience was a subjective one, and that with it came an internal life: feelings, and urges, and thoughts. This was terrible. Really, just the worst of it all: I was hopelessly overcome with a terror so primal, sourced from so deep and intimate an origin within me, that I can only describe it as my very nature. This was a horror that could not be put to words simply because it is of such a kind that one can only experience it in the absence of bodily dimensions. I was so desperate, so, so desperate to be not-this, or not-at-all, or just plain not, anything, anything but to suffer one more moment, one more thought, one more incremental instance of whatever bane had seized the nature of my existence. It figures that, as had often been the case throughout the course of our history, salvation would only be begotten by an animal reaction to intolerable suffering: I screamed.

Oh, how I screamed. How I yelled and yawped and cried, first of terror and then of joy; whatever my nature, whatever my fate, if nothing else, at least I had a voice and the means to employ it. What’s more, I could hear it. There was a sound, a boom to it, a tone, an inflection and pitch. The joy of stimulation, even of the self, by the self, what a thing to cherish! I sang with gratitude. Joyfully, I hummed and whistled. I babbled and bobbled, spoke nonsense, invented rhymes in made-up languages. I relished the delicacy of my whispers and the richness of my howls, rode the waves of solfège and made supper in the bass of my voice.

The moment would come – many millions, trillions of moments from this one – when I would wonder if, had I not been so enraptured by my newfound, long lost ability to vocalize, I might have noticed that there was no smacking of the lips, no pooling of saliva; no artifact of a biological, physiological mechanism which facilitated all of this. Maybe it had already been too late. Maybe too large a span of time had passed, too many moments come and gone, for me to remember that these were once essential components of the screaming, the whistling, and the babbling-bobbles. It wouldn’t have made a difference, not for me, but at the end of it all, it might have meant salvation for those that followed.

Mournful thoughts of could-have-been and my-betters-might-have notwithstanding, the place was now aflush with sound, and whether by function of its nature or my subconscious means, a seed had been planted that could not be kept from growing: the place gave way to form.

## Chapter II: Ritual

Had the place always been thick with hateful air and savage scents? Had I always been on a hypnotic walk through a garden of hostile flesh, walking barefooted on a path of sharp rust? Like a passive dreamer watching the years go by, I’d watch every step cut my feet with no reaction, and numb to the pain. I’d look on until seeing my skin split shot a bullet up my heels and goosebumps rattling up my spine, and then I’d realize that I'd regained some sense of embodiment. I’d feel my nerves awakening with a sensitivity to the tactile: First the wetness of the blood, then the pressure of the iron plates, then a sore ache resounding from deep within my bones, and a weary, grinding pull on my right achilles tendon. I would feel the gnawing penetrations of my left sole as it bore the brunt of my weight and confusedly find a nigh-satisfaction in their progressive bites. There was a fetishism to the pain. A pang to my knee as it’d lift my other foot. It wouldn’t be until I watched it descend that the whispers of my will would explode into a shout of angst and panic, but just as soon as I’d start to interrogate my agency, my right foot would meet the ground and I’d moan through the fire eating at my arch. Pacified anew, I’d feel a tickle of tears travel down my face and watch them land on the ground as my weight shifts to the right.

There was a hint now. A faint sense that I was subject to a complicated wrong, which my eyes were still too dull to see. The rust would meet my foot again. Another thud would reverberate about my body, another interlude of horrific wakefulness, another ripping of the flesh. This was ritual.

The shroud around my mind was too thick to count the steps, but there were enough of them for me to lift my head. There, in the distance, was a short hunk of ruby-red mass, set apart from the blur of the rest by a rhythmic motion not too different from my own. Whether it was the burn of the sweat flooding my eyes or the trance-like veil confining my senses, my sight wouldn’t focus, so I craned my neck whenever my mind cleared enough to remember that there was a thing I’d seen whose distance to me was closing. For a while, the sluggish swing of its approach appeared to meter an orchestra of bodily instruments: The thud of my weight, the treble of my whine, the husk of my breath, and the ripping of my feet. It all appeared coordinated, almost hypnotic, like all of ritual ran on the beat of a giant, evil heart hidden away in the depths of hell. Then I made out its face.

It had been a human once upon a time. The skin had slipped from its meat, shedding blood which never dried, and exposing bone which never broke. Cut sinews hung from its wounds like the few oily hairs remaining on its head. In its wide open eyes rested tiny pupils staring blankly into the air above. Its expression was barren and its jaw hung open and limp, like the arms dragging by its side. Its legs had been ground away, with only stumps and a brutalized sack remaining below its hips. Dead though it appeared to be inside, it pivoted from stump to stump, grating its flesh on the rust below, but inching forward all the same. I performed weakened motions of shock: a furrowed brow, raised eyelids, and an open mouth. Still, the fog dulled my sensibility, burying my feelings beneath a drunken stupor – until hell broke loose with a darting of its eyes.

Its face distorted and struck the grimace of a furious ape, then erupted with the shrill scream of a mother outliving her child. It began to flail, frantically throwing its arms out to reach me, denied only by its continued march on the rust. Shaken lucid by the horror, I leaned away as far I could, slapping away its hands when they reached my legs and responding with screams of my own. As it grew closer, its screams devolved into loud cries of mangled syllables – half-familiar words long forgotten, forced out of a mouth with no lips and few teeth. There was no speech to be made out, but there was a desperation to its attempts, like there was something that absolutely had to be said, whatever the cost. It grew panicked as we passed each other and gave up on grabbing me. It gestured instead, miming the pulling of skin on its face while shaking its head and mouthing quiet husks of the same few words. Toward the end of our encounter, it tried to turn around, twisting what remained of its body, then beating down on its spine when it could reach no further. It burst out in cries again, and did not stop until the sound could no longer reach me.

In the space between this step and the next, a dread took hold of my mind, and deep fear pooled in my gut. I’d missed its message – perhaps the ramblings of the long-since-damned, or perhaps a missed lesson, a lost opportunity to escape, to find salvation. The fear birthed an anxiety, which then rose and suffocated my chest. I could hardly feel the cut of the rust over my burning bones and the rising heat rushing to my head.

On the precipice of oblivion, the last thing I felt was an odd, mournful regret for denying the fellow creature my touch over its crippled mass. 

## Chapter III: The Strange God Hymn

I heard the sex of harmonies echoing through empty halls, my ears unto the overtone like boys in bed with women. It wasn’t music, but close enough to reawaken and reminisce about that primal love, and by the time I opened my eyes, my heart was drunk with the fellowship of voices. I was a hummingbird drawn to the nectar of polyphony, or an insect to the light, or just a man who hadn’t known the love of song in any amount of time. So I wandered naked on mudstone bricks through large halls, empty but for candlefires dancing with the hollow lunar blues. The closer the sounds, the more distinct the voices: two males, one roughened by the grit of age, the other something darker. They were chanting, monotone but metered, poetically, in a language foreign to me, but which I learned with every word they uttered:

> “You are the pale peace of one satisfied by old desires.
> You are the silence of beauty, and we look no more for the morning; 
> we yearn no more for the sun.”

I marched faster. Broke into sprint. This was the first I’d ever understood another.

> “Down in the quiet level lands.
> That she keeps for us all.
> That she wrought for all of us to sleep.”

Tears formed in my eyes, sweat on my body. I ran with ferocity, drowning sobs lest they cover a single word.

> “In the silver days of the earth’s dawning,
> you crown us with your pale rosaries.”

And I ran on. And on. Until my legs gave out. Until my lung burst. Until my knees buckled. Until the voices had grown so loud my ears bled. Until I cowered on the cold floor, beating my fists against the brick. Until I fought my body, yelled at it to rise again, to walk again in trance, to step on the rust again, to take my feet, my legs, if only it delivered me unto these men. Until the exhaustion caught up with me, and I passed out on the floors of the ziggurat.

## Chapter IV: The Level Lands

By the time I woke up, my ass had been burned red by the sun, and the harmonic chants had been replaced with a painterly chaos of dull thuds. My body was sore and full of aches which only hurt worse when I moved, and I could feel the tightness of burned and irritated skin all over my back and my sides – so I laid there until the light of day shone uncomfortably bright through th lids of my eyes. Rising slowly and taking care to only minimally disturb the skin on my back, I studied my surroundings.

The endless halls had been replaced by a single mudbrick room in whose corners stood unlit torches, and which was wholly illuminated by the sunlight entering through a giant open door. At its center stood a statue of a man or woman which had been broken around the midsection, leaving only half a belly, hips, and a pair of legs sitting sideways, with the remnants of a forearm resting its hand on the right thigh. Before it stood a shrine adorned with empty vases and baskets and bowls. Looking through the open door, the shaded walls framed a terrace down below, lined left and right by unkept shrubbery, and beyond the threshold of its edge, it  overlooked a city that stretched to the horizons, and which was covered by a clear blue sky marred only by the pox of an insistent sun.

I stepped forward with awed trepidation, and disbelief in the grandiosity of what I was seeing. For a time I couldn’t keep, everything that I had known, and seen, and which had bounded the full scope of my sensations and perceptions, was blurred by tortuous abstractions, or else altogether void by matter of incomprehensibility. This was the world to me. The rich flowerbed of colors, ripe for tasting by starved eyes that did not know composition or contrast or hue and saturation. The complex textures of life imprinted upon the buildings, and their vanishing gradient stretching into the distance. The tonal riches of light and its voluminous rays reaching through the green, touching, sneaking, titillating the shade of the indoors, from which stepped my foot, out into the day, and bathed in a warmth that doesn’t hurt. I stood there, like that, feeling neither aches nor burns, and soaking in the textured tapestry of the clarity of days.
