It comes in the night – every night, like clockwork. All it ever takes is one errant thought, a careless tangent in my mind, and just like that; paralyzing fear. It’s the time that’s passed me by, the regret of the days wasted, the dread of the stink of failure beginning to rise from the rot of my age. I am 39 years old, and my life is a hollow husk built on lies and paid for by parents that I should have retired years ago. I have no friends. My heart is too weak to love anymore. I write poor poems to fuel fantasies of sudden, explosive success that will solve all of my problems and save me from the hell that I have built myself. Welcome to the worst future: The one where all your dreams turned into nightmares, and you have no one to blame but your pitiful self.

Writing the truth doesn’t soothe the wound of living it, and so I’m stuck wondering what else there is to do. I can’t kill myself – it would break my parents hearts, my dogs still need me, and I can’t quit while I could still offer some semblance of assistance to my sister. But I am very tired, and very sad, and every week I feel more and more like happiness is out of reach, and all that’s left for me is the blissful relief of temporary distraction: A video game here, a poem there, and every few years a relationship I’ll drag out longer than I should.

At least I get to love my dogs. But even that I don’t do well. I’m so sorry about the chocolate, Howie. I’m so sorry about the years spent living in a car, Roscoe. I’m so, so sorry for killing you, Daisy. And I’m sorry for hurting you, Chicho, and Frankie, and Scrunkle, and Balu. And Stephanie, and Candy. And Emily. And Anabeth. And Jo. So many names, and there are many more, and many with no name at all.

I am a monster that needs to die. But I need to do it without making more mistakes.

Please. Please. Can I start over?
I really, desperately wish that I could start over. Can I just start over, PLEASE!

CAN YOU HEAR ME?

I NEED TO START OVER!
