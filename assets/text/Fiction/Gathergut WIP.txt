## Part I: Collapse

It comes in the night – every night, like clockwork. All it ever takes is one errant thought, a careless tangent in my mind, and just like that: paralyzing fear. It’s the time that’s passed me by, the regret of the days wasted, the dread of the stink of failure beginning to rise from the rot of my age. Tonight it was particularly bad, so I sat naked in the sick light of my mute TV, and poured my misery unto a page:

:d>“I am 39 years old, and my life is a hollow husk built on lies, and paid for by blue collar parents that I should have retired years ago. I have no friends. My heart is too weak to love anymore. I write poor poems to fuel fantasies of sudden, explosive success that will solve all of my problems and save me from the hell that I have built myself.”

I struggled. There was too much honesty in it, and it hurt all the more because I knew that none of the words I was writing would ever change a single thing. I was crying my pains into the void knowing full well their echoes would never reach me.

:d>“Welcome to the worst future, Isaiah: The one where all your dreams turned into nightmares, and you have no one to blame but your pitiful self. Writing the truth doesn’t soothe the wound of living it, and so I’m stuck wondering what else there is to do. I can’t kill myself.“

I hesitated for a moment, trying to summon reasons I could list with some conviction, but settled for the usual platonics that are true, but don’t curb the misery:

:d>“It would break my parents hearts, my dogs still need me, and I can’t quit while I could still offer some semblance of assistance to my sister. But I am very tired, and very sad, and every week I feel more and more like happiness is out of reach, and all that’s left for me is the blissful relief of temporary distraction: A video game here, a poem there, and every few years a relationship that I’ll drag out longer than I should.”

My heart was teetering close to the abyss. This skin once belonged to a boy with promise and with dreams. His back broke beneath the weight of his mistakes, and so now he was me: an old and whiny bitch of an aging man. I had wasted his life and hated myself. But I loved my mother too much to write more honest things about her son, so I tried to adjust:

:d>“At least I get to love my dogs. But even that I don’t do well. I’m so sorry about the pills, Howie. I’m so sorry about the years spent living in a car, Roscoe. I’m so, so sorry for killing you, Daisy. And I’m sorry for hurting you, Chico, and Frankie, and Scrunkle, and Balu. And Stephanie, and Candy. And Emily. And Anabeth. And Jo.”

So many names, and there are many more, and many with no name at all.

:d>“I am a monster that needs to die. But I need to do it without making more mistakes.”

The desperation dug deeper in my chest.

:d>"Please. Please. Can I start over?
:d>I really, desperately wish that I could start over. Can I just start over, PLEASE!”

I was suffocating.

:d>“CAN YOU HEAR ME?”

:d>“I NEED TO START OVER!”

I put the pen down, and I cried ugly. Howie came to investigate. I pet his head and let my snot drip to the floor. The depressive pit of my apartment was a lost cause anyway. There was nothing to salvage. No reason to care. My pleas fell on deaf ears.

:d>The universe doesn’t care. Maybe I don’t either. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to write. It’s all real to me, do you know that? To you it’s a story on the internet, it’s fiction in a forum. But it’s real.

This really is my life. It will still be my life when you finish reading.

:d>I don’t know what you’ll feel as you read this. Maybe you find it grossly pathetic. Maybe my writing is so shit that you’re amused. Maybe you’re just bored. To be honest, I don’t really care what you’re feeling. I just hope there’s someone reading this at all. And that you stay with me until the end. Even if it’s bad. Maybe we can be friends until then. If it’s bad, if I write it bad, maybe we can laugh at it together. Just please don’t let me be alone right now. I don’t deserve your comfort, but my skin has grown thinner and thinner, and it’s all gotten to be too much. Even the small things hurt me. I’ll stick it out either way, because mom, and dad, and the dogs. But it will hurt less with you here.

A heart can only take so much before it needs a reprieve from the intensity, so there comes a point where your breakdown simmers down and the pain and anxiety give way to numbness. That’s where you stop crying and just sort of sit there; the pathetic, naked meat of man. You enter a kind of stupor, and it takes a bit before you realize that you’ve just been sitting there and staring blankly for a while. That’s where I was at when I noticed Howie staring at the open window.


## Part II: Visitor

2:12 AM in rural Massachusetts. It was pitch black outside, and I had one of my twin windows open. There, hanging on to the window screen with giant talons, was the grotesque, feathered visage of a creature the size of a bike. It looked almost like a kind of disfigured owl, but there was a strangeness to it – this did not register as an animal. By instinct, I knew it to be intelligent.
:p>I can’t explain the things that happened next. I can’t tell you why I did the things that I did, nor why I didn’t do the things that you would expect. All I can do is tell you that neither Howie nor Roscoe made any kind of sound, and that they both stayed as they had been, and calmly watched as I asked the beast:

:d>“Is this about starting over?”

The creature made a raspy barking sound.

:d>“Can I go back?”

It said nothing, but I watched its giant pupils narrow, and its feathers ruffle. I waited. A dry, and deep voice boomed with the movements of its beak:

:d>“Come.”

This was the fried voice of a wretched, ancient authority. Rooted in its bass was an alien nobility, something foreign which resonated with me and made the world around the beast fade into obscurity.

:d>“Come down.”

:d>“Okay.”

Still naked, I stepped toward my apartment door before stopping, looking to Howie and Roscoe, and asking:

:d>“Will they be okay?”

The creature’s pupils narrowed yet again. It moved its beak without speaking – as if chewing on its own tongue – while slowly tilting its head. We looked at each other. Whatever life there was behind its eyes was a mystery to me, but I could sense that it was reading mine.

:d>“I will care for them.”

It turned its head to each of the dogs, and its beak moved to the sound of chatter. They came to me, and they looked at me, and I pet them, and hugged them, and I told them that I love them. Minutes passed before I finally let go. I looked back up at the creature.

:d>“Thank you.”

:d>“Come down.”

And I turned around, opened the door, and made my way down the stairs.
