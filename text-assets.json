      "content": "It's standard practice among direct action groups to designate a point person for all law enforcement exchanges if you're expecting arrests. This is usually someone who has been trained on how to handle these interactions and who is not themselves risking arrest. Everyone else is generally instructed to tell inquiring law enforcement that they should speak to this liaison but not acknowledge them as any sort of leader/authority. You're not supposed to say anything beyond that unless absolutely necessary.\n\nBetween the backpack and the calm demeanor, I'd bet money that that is exactly what you're seeing play out here. If so, the two men in the clip played their roles perfectly -- the protester primarily addressed the crowd and only spoke to law enforcement to the extent required to comply with their requests, while the mediator was indistinguishable from bystanders until the moment he was needed.\n\n(<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/chaoticgood/comments/1k6awud/a_protester_defaces_trumps_faux_presidential_seal/moph4v8/\">Source</a>)",

      "content": "That deep trauma has its claws in you, and with every jolt, you can feel it tearing your flesh, your mind, your heart, your thought, your bits and pieces, and all things recognizably human and feeling and lovable by a mother, to wounds and mushy, blood-wrung tissue. You understand that you are unmade by every one of these experiences, and that this has already cost you every semblance of the functional human being you once were. Stuck in a torrent of unintelligible experience, you find yourself drowning without the slightest knowledge of how to swim, how to control water, or even know its nature.\n\nAnd then it clicks, then fades. Something about that analogy – it connected something, illuminated something in a space that had been dark for so long. Try desperately to capture it, envision it: a man, deaf, dumb, blind, drowning in a torrent of water, a substance he’s never known. He won’t escape if all he does is swallow water and try to taste changes in its salinity. He, you, wasting time: How can he escape? What can he do in that moment, if anything?\n\nMove your arms. Feel the essence of the element: liquid, it moves, it gives, physically, it exerts its force on you, but you can move throughout it nonetheless. Where does it give? Where does it resist? Can you discern directions? Do you know up from down from left from right? Where is it easiest to breathe?\n\nStop. Know a useless question. You don’t know the non-linearities that stack to compose your reality. Reckon with the constants. What are the constants? The constants are the torrent, its unknowns. The water, its physicality. You. Who are you? Who are you? What’s a you, the you? You is a pronoun. He, she, they, it, me, I – where is I? I is normal, it defines your equilibrium. Why a you, why not an I? Compose an I. Who am I?\nJoy.\n\nNow I am joyful. Joyful, excited, exhilarated, at the first step forward in too long a time to know: I. I exist, I think, I am, I know like that old frenchman who couldn’t tell his god from his demon, that essential and most fundamental of truths, that I am I, and I exist, and right now, that is the most exhilarating truth in all the worlds: I am. And as I am, and I am joyful, I feel all the elements of this world shift, and its being change, and before long, time jolts.",

      "category": "Fiction",
      "content": "**Chapter I: Good Morning Vietnam.**\n\nIt began with a rapture darkness that covered the world. There were no verbs, nor subjects to seize them; there was no tightness, nor egress to relieve it. An absence of all percepts, and all which would perceive, no sense nor space to anchor relativity. A nothing so nothing, it defied causality, left null and never all of time and temporality. It was symphonic and cacophony, it was mundane and special all the same, it was all that ever was and ever would be, it was the start, the end, and the in-between. Until it popped, or faded, all at once, or very slowly, unseen by anyone, but known to everyone in hindsight.\n\nHowever it happened, what was before gave way to a soreness, something like a raw wound, like a gash after birth, or like an infant blinded by the first sight of the sun. It was all so much, so overwhelming – it might have burned out what eyes I still had, made me bleed out my ears if I could only have remembered the blood in my veins, or a heart to pump it. That was my first missed sign of the incorporeal, ironically: All the things-that-were-too-much overwhelmed my senses, but never hurt what would once have been my body. If only I’d realized that there was still a me worth a thought.\n\nI was there, like that, not standing or sitting, not lying or floating, but just being, for a stretch that drew out so long that it seemed to defy description by units of time. Whatever I was, or whatever I’d come to be, it took a lot of that, it cost me much of that, to adjust to it, to compress the buzz and the noise and the all-too-much of it all, until slowly, it began to take shape. It seemed at first like the afterimage of a light you’d looked at for far too long, or the forms and not-quite-forms that you see when you close your eyes. It was vague and abstract, and it would never take hold, and for the longest time, a portion of my mind would always be occupied attempting to interpret the sheer signal of it all… Still, the moment came when, at last,  I could interpret some semblance of what I reckon to be a place.\nI call it a place because all other terms (like world, or space, or environment) ascribe it too many qualities that I could not yet positively identify. It wasn’t entirely clear to me whether the place had an end, or boundaries, or dimensions of any kind. What features it most definitely had were scarce: it exists, and I exist in some location within it. It was a strange, intellectual thing, and something entirely foreign to what I’d come to know as corporeal space.\n\nOn finding the place, I’d initially been far too confused and out of my element to feel much of anything, but in time I remembered that there was such a thing that it was like to be, that is, that my experience was a subjective one, and that with it came an internal life: feelings, and urges, and thoughts. This was terrible. Really, just the worst of it all: I was hopelessly overcome with a terror so primal, sourced from so deep and intimate an origin within me, that I can only describe it as my very nature. This was a horror that could not be put to words simply because it is of such a kind that one can only experience it in the absence of bodily dimensions. I was so desperate, so, so desperate to be not-this, or not-at-all, or just plain not, anything, anything but to suffer one more moment, one more thought, one more incremental instance of whatever bane had seized the nature of my existence. It figures that, as had often been the case throughout the course of our history, salvation would only be begotten by an animal reaction to intolerable suffering: I screamed.\n\nOh, how I screamed. How I yelled and yawped and cried, first of terror and then of joy; whatever my nature, whatever my fate, if nothing else, at least I had a voice and the means to employ it. What’s more, I could hear it. There was a sound, a boom to it, a tone, an inflection and pitch. The joy of stimulation, even of the self, by the self, what a thing to cherish! I sang with gratitude. Joyfully, I hummed and whistled. I babbled and bobbled, spoke nonsense, invented rhymes in made-up languages. I relished the delicacy of my whispers and the richness of my howls, rode the waves of solfège and made supper in the bass of my voice.\n\nThe moment would come – many millions, trillions of moments from this one – when I would wonder if, had I not been so enraptured by my newfound, long lost ability to vocalize, I might have noticed that there was no smacking of the lips, no pooling of saliva; no artifact of a biological, physiological mechanism which facilitated all of this. Maybe it had already been too late. Maybe too large a span of time had passed, too many moments come and gone, for me to remember that these were once essential components of the screaming, the whistling, and the babbling-bobbles. It wouldn’t have made a difference, not for me, but at the end of it all, it might have meant salvation for those that followed.\nMournful thoughts of could-have-been and my-betters-might-have notwithstanding, the place was now aflush with sound, and whether by function of its nature or my subconscious means, a seed had been planted that could not be kept from growing: the place gave way to form.\n",

At one point we went to this little deck by its bank when out of nowhere the river rises and we get caught in it. My mom, my brother, and I managed to climb up the stairs (and cry), but my dad dove straight in after my mom's purse which had been caught by the water.We had a tiny poodle at the time that was famously wimpy (her name was Millie and she would pee herself whenever she got too excited or scared -- even yelling at her would do the job), but she was also extremely attached to specifically my dad. When he dove after the purse, she dove after him and tried to pull this large 250 lbs German man towards the land by his wrist. She almost drowned in the process.\n\nWhen we moved to the states we were worried that the Florida climate would be too much for her as she was really fluffy and weak of constitution, so we rehomed her with close family friends that spoiled her rotten and kept us updated on how she was doing. She passed away last year, but every time my dad visited Germany, he'd go and see her.",

      "content": "In 1825, a wealthy man by the name of Abel Gower purchased an estate on the eastern border of the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire. Taking inspiration from the nearby oaks, this estate would come to be known as “Clunderwen”, a composite of the Welsh word “Clun”, meaning meadow, and “Derwen”, meaning oak. As the estate and its surrounding lands developed, there came a point half a century later at which the local community began to find itself in need of a name – and so, owing to the influence of the family, the area came to adopt the name of the Gower estate. This is why, two hundred years after Abel signed the documents that ascribed him his property rights, some one-thousand people now claim a hometown of “Clynderwen”.\n\nIn 1897, “Clynderwen” would then be marked down in the birth certificate of one Griffith Wynne Williams, who would continue to live there until he left for a boarding school in London. On completion of his secondary studies in 1923, Griffith Wynne would leave the Welsh oaks behind for good, moving to the United States to attend what is now known as the Hartford International University for Religion and Peace. By 1929, Griffith had reached the end of his educational pursuits with the completion of a doctoral degree in Psychology at the University of Wisconsin. He would go on to teach at Rutgers University, where he would earn the 1958 award of the Society of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis.\n\nIt was this award – and the published research which had afforded him the honor – that would ultimately allow him to meet the notability requirement of the New York Times Obit desk, which wrote, approved, and published his obituary on the 26th of April, 1972. Griffith Wynne was survived by his widow Dr. Hannah Stiglitz Williams, his daughter Mona Brown, his son Gresham, three brothers, and three grandchildren. He lived to the age of 75, passing one hundred forty seven years after Abel Gower bought a house surrounded by aging oaks in the Welsh countryside.\n\nTen years before he died, Griffith had submitted a manuscript to the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, which would go on to publish it in the third issue of its eleventh volume. In it, he would coin the term “Highway Hypnosis”, describing the following phenomenon: \n",
